# SIT313 assignment1
Week 1&2
No idea about xamarin at all. Only part of the code is written following the contents of the unit chair class. 
These two weeks of practice made me familiar with writing iOS and Android program code using C# in the visual studio.
I became more familiar with visual studio's interface.




Week 3&4
Based on the study in the first two weeks, I began to have some ideas on assignment 1. The first is screen switching. 
Almost all apps have a login and registration interface. Only after the user has completed the login or registration 
interface can they truly use the app. So, my first step is to use xamarin to create an Android app login and registration 
system. After the user logs in or completes registration, the app's interface is automatically converted into an image 
interface which is a function that can be converted by clicking on it.
However, the functions are not complete yet. For example, the app cannot store user names and passwords. This will cause user 
to have to re-register each time to log in. In addition, user name, password and mailbox in the login and registration have no 
review function. Which means the username, password, and mailbox can be null or arbitrary characters.

Week 5
Finally, it's done. I added code to the login and registration interface to check that the username, password, and mailbox are 
empty or not. Following my experience with Android studio, I added a database that stores user names, passwords and mailboxes. 
It also adds a new interface, an interface for a list view. But clicking on item to add the description fails.
Since image switch and list view are two different interfaces, I automatically jump to a new selection interface after 
successfully log in or registeration. There are three buttons in this interface: image switch, list view and logout button. 
I also added the return button on image switch and list view, respectively. The return button is returned to the selection 
screen.
